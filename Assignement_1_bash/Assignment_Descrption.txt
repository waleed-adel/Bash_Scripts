Summary:
	The goal of this Assignment  is to practice the basics of Shell Scripting Usage and Capabilities.

Requirements:
	Create a shell script that creates a phonebook on your system that contains a list of your contact names and numbers, with these features:
	- Script can take options, e.g. "phonebook -v"
	- When running the script without options, it will print the phonebook available options.
	- Normally there is a “.phonebookDB.txt” which ur script creates to store the names and numbers. 
	*Bonus1: make the database inside the script itself (meaning the script would edit itself while running), that would make your script highly portable.
	*Bonus2: a single name can have multiple phone numbers within the same database entry.

The available options are:
	- Insert new contact name and number, with the option "-i"
	- View all saved contacts details, with the option "-v"
	- Search by contact name, with the option "-s" 
	- Delete all records, with "-e"
	- Delete only one contact name, with "-d"

Common bugs you need to take care of:
	- When moving the script from one folder to the other make sure your script points to a single location for the database file (think where should an application keep its data!?) Hint: /etc/phonebook
	- Your script must check if a database file exist before trying to create a new one

Test Scenarios:
	- I will normally try to make your script break or behave incorrectly so use defensive coding strategy to counter wrong user inputs
	- The inputs will contain names with similarities ( e.g. “ahmed ali”, “ali ahmed”, “Ali Ali”  etc)(which to delete ?!)
