Summary:
	The goal of this Assignment  is to practice the basics of Shell Scripting Usage and Capabilities.
	*Bonus: get familiar with daemons. 

Requirements:
	Implement, as a script, a "safe" delete command, sdel.sh. 
	Filenames passed as command-line arguments to this script are not deleted, but instead gzipped if not already compressed (use file to check), then moved to a ~/TRASH directory. Upon invocation, the script checks the ~/TRASH directory for files older than 48 hours and permanently deletes them.
	*Bonus1:Make the script periodically invoked by the “cron” daemon
	*Bonus2:Write the script so it can handle files and directories recursively. This would give it the capability of "safely deleting" entire directory structures.

Common bugs you need to take care of:
	- The script should create only 1 TRASH directory in the home directory for the user who is currently using it.
	- The script shouldn’t compress a file if it is already compressed(Hint: don't rely on filenames for that check)
	- Make sure that ur script is portable (e.g. don't use smth like /home/ahmed/....)
	- If i passed multiple files or directories to the script it should handle each one alone and provide a zipped file for each entry

Test Scenarios:
	- I will normally try to make your script break or behave incorrectly so use defensive coding strategy to counter wrong user inputs
	- I will call the script with single parameters and multiple parameter
	- The input parameters can be files and/or directories
